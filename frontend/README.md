# WEBPAYWALL Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Natural Wellness site. The codebase is organized into modular components:

- `src/components/` — Reusable UI components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- `src/pages/` — Top-level pages (Home, Blog, Ebook, Auth)
- `src/sections/` — Major page sections (Hero, Features, BlogGrid, EbookGrid, etc.)
- `src/services/` — API calls and data fetching logic
- `src/utils/` — Utility functions
- `src/styles/` — Global styles and theme

Each artifact will be broken down and placed in the appropriate folder.
